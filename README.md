# README

## Getting Started

This is Chance Robinson's implementation of the technical test for XXXXX, designed to assess adaptability and proficiency in learning new technologies, specifically focusing on Node.js and Express.js.

### Prerequisites

Make sure Node.js is installed (version 18.6).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

2. Change the current working directory to the project folder.

    ```bash
    cd [project_folder]
    ```

3. Run the following command to install dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Execute either of the following commands to run the project.

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    node .
    ```

5. For unit tests, run 

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

## Roadmap

- Move static tasks to a separate file (e.g., `.txt`) to decouple dependencies in `taskControllers.js`.
- Dockerize the project to eliminate the need for a specific Node.js version.
